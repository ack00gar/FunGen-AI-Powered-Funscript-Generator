"""
Integration tests for regression fixes to prevent future regressions.

These tests cover critical fixes implemented to resolve:
1. Stage 1 FPS regression (GPU memory optimization)
2. aiosqlite missing module errors (optional import)  
3. hevc_qsv encoder fallback issues
4. Database retention configuration
5. Database deletion safety in 3-stage pipelines
6. Preprocessed video workflow automation
