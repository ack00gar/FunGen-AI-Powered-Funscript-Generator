### DISCLAIMER

This project is still at the early stages of development. It is not intended for commercial use. Please, do not use this project for any commercial purposes without prior consent from the author. It is for individual use only.

---

## Prerequisites

Before using this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.8 or higher (tested on 3.11 https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3118/)**
- **FFmpeg** added to your PATH or specified under the settings menu (https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html)

## Installation

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ack00gar/VR-Funscript-AI-Generator.git
cd VR-Funscript-AI-Generator
```

### Install dependencies

- Install miniconda (https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/install/) (We removed venv as all the bat files use conda)
- Start a miniconda command prompt

#### If your GPU supports CUDA (NVIDIA)

```bash
conda create -n VRFunAIGen python=3.11
conda activate VRFunAIGen
pip install -r core.requirements.txt
pip install -r cuda.requirements.txt
python FSGenerator.py
```

While executing, you‚Äôll need to say ‚Äúyes‚Äù a few times. The lines ‚Äúpip uninstall / pip3 install‚Äù is to replace the ‚ÄúCPU‚Äù version of torch with a ‚Äúcuda enabled / GPU‚Äù version (you might need to install nvidia CUDA stuff for it to works, I‚Äôm not sure).

#### If your GPU doesn't support cuda

```bash
conda create -n VRFunAIGen python=3.11
conda activate VRFunAIGen
pip install -r core.requirements.txt
pip install -r cpu.requirements.txt
python FSGenerator.py
```

### Download the YOLO model
- Place the YOLO model file(s) in the `models/` sub-directory. If you aren't sure you can add all the models and let the app decide the best option for you.

We support multiple model formats across Windows, macOS, and Linux.
#### Recommendations
- NVIDIA Cards: we recommend the .engine model
- AMD Cards: we recommend .pt (requires ROCm see below)
- Mac: we recommend .mlmodel

#### Models
- **.pt (PyTorch)**: Requires CUDA (for NVIDIA GPUs) or ROCm (for AMD GPUs) for acceleration.
- **.onnx (ONNX Runtime)**: Best for CPU users as it offers broad compatibility and efficiency.
- **.engine (TensorRT)**: For NVIDIA GPUs: Provides very significant efficiency improvements.
- **.mlmodel (Core ML)**: Optimized for macOS users. Runs efficiently on Apple devices with Core ML.

In most cases, the app will automatically detect the best model from your models directory at launch, but if the right model wasn't present at this time or the right dependencies where not installed, you might need to override it under settings. The same applies when we release a new version of the model.


#### AMD GPU acceleration
Coming soon

### (Optional) Settings
Find the settings menu in the app to configure optional option.

### Start script

You can use Start windows.bat to launch the gui on windows if you installed with conda

## Command Line Usage

To generate a single script with cmd or terminal, run the following command

```bash
python -m script_generator.cli.generate_funscript_single /path/to/video.mp4
```

See examples/windows/Process single video.bat for an example

To generate scripts for all files in a folder use

```bash
python -m script_generator.cli.generate_funscript_folder /path/to/folder
```

See examples/windows/Process folder.bat for an example

### Command-Line Arguments (Shared)

#### Required Arguments

- **`video_path`** Path to the input video file.

#### Optional Arguments

- **`--reuse-yolo`** Re-use an existing raw YOLO output file instead of generating a new one when available.
- **`--copy-funscript`** Copies the final funscript to the movie directory.
- **`--save-debug-file`** Saves a debug file to disk with all collected metrics. Also allows you to re-use tracking data.

#### Optional Funscript Tweaking Settings

- **`--boost-enabled`** Enable boosting to adjust the motion range dynamically.
- **`--boost-up-percent`** Increase the peaks by a specified percentage to enhance upper motion limits.
- **`--boost-down-percent`** Reduce the lower peaks by a specified percentage to limit downward motion.
- **`--threshold-enabled`** Enable thresholding to control motion mapping within specified bounds.
- **`--threshold-low`** Values below this threshold are mapped to 0, limiting lower boundary motion.
- **`--threshold-high`** Values above this threshold are mapped to 100, limiting upper boundary motion.
- **`--vw-simplification-enabled`** Simplify the generated script to reduce the number of points, making it user-friendly.
- **`--vw-factor`** Determines the degree of simplification. Higher values lead to fewer points.
- **`--rounding`** Set the rounding factor for script values to adjust precision.

### Command-Line Arguments (Folder mode)

- **`--replace-outdated`** Will regenerate outdated funscripts.
- **`--replace-up-to-date`** Will regenerate funscripts that are up to date and made by this app too.
- **`--num-workers`** Number of subprocesses to run in parallel. If you have beefy hardware 4 seems to be the sweet spot but technically your VRAM is the limit.

## Performance & Parallel Processing

Our pipeline's current bottleneck lies in the Python code within YOLO.track (the object detection library we use), which is challenging to parallelize effectively in a single process.

However, when you have high-performance hardware you can use the command line (see above) to processes multiple videos simultaneously. Alternatively you can launch multiple instances of the GUI.

We tested speeds of about 60 to 110 fps for 8k 8bit vr videos when running a single process. Which translates to faster then realtime processing already. However, running in parallel mode we tested
speeds of about 160 to 190 frames per second (for object detection). Meaning processing times of about 20 to 30 minutes for 8bit 8k VR videos for the complete process. More then twice the speed of realtime!

Keep in mind your results may vary as this is very dependent on your hardware. Cuda capable cards will have an advantage here. However, since the pipeline is largely CPU and video decode bottlenecked
a top of the line card like the 4090 is not required to get similar results. Having enough VRAM to run 3-6 processes, paired with a good CPU, will speed things up considerably though.

**Important considerations:**

- Each instance requires the YOLO model to load which means you'll need to keep checks on your VRAM to see how many you can load.
- The optimal number of instances depends on a combination of factors, including your CPU, GPU, RAM, and system configuration. So experiment with different setups to find the ideal configuration for your hardware! üòä

## Miscellaneous

- For VR only **Fisheye** and **Equirectangular** 180¬∞ videos are supported
- 2D POV videos have limited support
- 2D / VR is automatically detected for fisheye/equirectangular detection (make sure you keep the file format information in the filename _FISHEYE190, _MKX200, _LR_180, etc.)
- 2D / VR settings can also be overwritten in the UI if the app doesn't detect it properly

## Output Files

The script generates the following files in the output directory of you project folder:

1. `_rawyolo.msgpack`: Raw YOLO detection data. Can be re-used when re-generating scripts
2. `_rawfunscript.json`: Raw Funscript data. Can be re-used when re-generating script with different settings.
3. `.funscript`: Final Funscript file.
4. `_heatmap.png`: Heatmap visualization of the Funscript data.
5. `_comparefunscripts.png`: Comparison visualization between the generated Funscript and the reference Funscript (if provided).
6. `_adjusted.funscript`: Funscript file with adjusted amplitude.
7. `_metrics.msgpack`: Contains all the raw metrics collected and can be used to debug your video when processing is completed.

## About the project
### Project Genesis and Evolution

This project started as a dream to automate Funscript generation for VR videos. Here‚Äôs a brief history of its development:

- **Initial Approach (OpenCV Trackers)**: The first version relied on OpenCV trackers to detect and track objects in the video. While functional, the approach was slow (8‚Äì20 FPS) and struggled with occlusions and complex scenes.
- **Transition to YOLO**: To improve accuracy and speed, the project shifted to using YOLO object detection. A custom YOLO model was trained on a dataset of 1000nds annotated VR video frames, significantly improving detection quality.
- **Original Post**: For more details and discussions, check out the original post on EroScripts:  
  [VR Funscript Generation Helper (Python + CV/AI)](https://discuss.eroscripts.com/t/vr-funscript-generation-helper-python-now-cv-ai/202554)

### Pipeline Overview

The pipeline for generating Funscript files is as follows:

1. **YOLO Object Detection**: A YOLO model detects relevant objects (e.g., penis, hands, mouth, etc.) in each frame of the video. 
2. **Tracking Algorithm**: A custom tracking algorithm processes the YOLO detection results to track the positions of objects over time. The algorithm calculates distances and interactions between objects to determine the Funscript positions.
3. **Funscript Generation**: The tracked data is used to generate a raw Funscript file.
4. **Simplifier**: The raw Funscript data is simplified to remove noise and smooth out the motion resulting in a final `.funscript` file.
